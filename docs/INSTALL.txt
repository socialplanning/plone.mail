plone.mail Installation
=======================

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install plone.mail``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:

 * Create a file called ``plone.mail-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="plone.mail" />
